            <p>
                We are a boutique EHS firm built & customized according to our client’s 
                environmental and safety needs since 2019. Do not believe for a moment 
                that we cannot size up with the big dogs in the industry. What we 
                “strategically” lack in size; we make up in “bite.”  At our conception, 
                Ark was solely a solution maker for NYC’s R.E. Developers and General 
                Contractors struggling to comply with NYC’s construction safety and building codes.
            </p>
            <p>
                From humble baby steps we have evolved into a one of a kind EHS service provider 
                offering clients multiple world-class services by world-class professionals in the 
                field(s) of Construction Industry, General Industry, Industrial Hygiene, Industrial 
                Psychology, Human Resources and Performance Coaching.
