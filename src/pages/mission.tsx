        <h1> Mission Statement</h1> 
        <p className="text-box">
            Here at Ark Construction Safety and Health, it is our 
            mission to keep everyone safe and sound.  Ark’s Consultants 
            are self-motivated, well-disciplined, and highly educated 
            in their respective domains.  We understand the constant 
            grind/cost it takes to effectively run a business; due to 
            some of our own consultants coming from owning their own 
            companies or were once employed at high levels of management.  
            We will guide you in developing and maintaining a healthy 
            HASP along with accountability skills to run it effectively.

            According to OSHA regulations, the employer is required by 
            law to provide a safe working environment for their employees.  
            Cutting the cost on safety increases the chances of paying a 
            price far greater than monetary value.  It is more trivial to 
            regain trust and reputation from your workforce than recording 
            profits.  When your employees are safe, the company saves a 
            lot more money in the long run by reducing workers’ compensation, 
            medical, lost time, turnovers, and recruitment costs to replace 
            the injured or deceased.

            Is it worth the cost of not treating safety as an investment?  We are 
            here to help make businesses end up more profitable in all dimensions 
            that money can’t always afford.
